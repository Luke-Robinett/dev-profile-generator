# Developer Profile Generator
## Creates a PDF report based on a developer's GitHub profile

This is a node.JS app that prompts the user for their GitHub profile name and favorite color and then pulls data from their GitHub profile to build a report. It outputs this report as a PDF file.

This app utilizes several libraries, including:
- Axiom for accessing the GitHub API and retrieving the data
- Inquirer for prompting the user for input
- Electron-PDF for converting the HTML page into a PDF file
